			<p><strong>Portfolio Manager Consultancy Ltd. (PMCL)</strong> is a consultancy business established by Edward Jewson to advise charities on their investment management. PMCL's approach is based on two pillars - that of deep understanding of charity portfolio management and expertise in global investment research. <span><%= link_to "Read more...", "", id:"read-more" %></span> <span><%= link_to "Read less...", "", class:"hidden", id:"read-less" %></span></p>
			<p class="read-more hidden">We strive to help charity trustees achieve best performance with their fund managers. We work with the trustees to make a thorough assessment of the investment policy and the incumbent fund management arrangements. We enhance charity investment policies to become beyond formal and fully reflect their particular investment targets. We do this through taking an out-of-the box approach to asset allocation and bench-mark setting by looking at a broader range of asset classes than traditionally used by many charities. We conduct professional and fully impartial manager and performance review.
			<br></br>
			We aspire to challenge the existing status-quo to ensure that investment process is truly aligned with the particular needs of our clients. Our thorough and detailed review highlights the areas where fund managers have performed well, as well as the areas with potential for improvement. If the trustees conclude that they would like to change fund managers, we can carry out a beauty parade of suitable managers with the view to finding a replacement.
			<br></br>
			PMCL is not affiliated with any fund manager and only receives its remuneration from its clients and therefore remains completely impartial.
