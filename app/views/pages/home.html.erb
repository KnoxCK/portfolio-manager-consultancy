			<h3>Impartial professional investment consultancy firm established by Edward Jewson</h3>
			<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></i>FOCUS ON CHARITIES, ENDOWMENTS, FOUNDATIONS AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANISATIONS</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>We combine a deep understanding of institutional investors' needs and expertise in global investment research. We offer flexible and tailored services for the individual needs of each of our clients, rather than packaged solutions.</p>
			<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></i>IMPARTIAL ADVICE</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>We are not affiliated with any fund management group and only receive our remuneration from our clients.</p>
			<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></i>PROFESSIONAL SERVICE</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>Portfolio Manager Consultancy Ltd (PMCL) is a regulated business, which we view as a matter of good governance, compliance discipline and professionalism. We have a wide range of permissions so our regulatory status enables us to offer a broad range of  investment consulting services for the benefit of our clients.
			</p>
			<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></i>FOCUS ON SUSTAINABILITY</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>We take a comprehensive approach to sustainable investments and assist our clients in  finding a solution which addresses their particular needs and is both practical and robust. We are signatories to UN PRI and members of UKSIF. We are strong believers in the benefits of fully incorporating ESG into the investment process, which we have found significant academic evidence to support. We think it is perfectly possible to construct portfolios which adhere to sustainability criteria without sacrificing returns.
			</p>
			<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></i>GLOBAL APPROACH</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>We are also strong supporters of a diversified global approach to investment recognising that while the UK has a highly developed financial market not all growth sectors are well represented. We may therefore be somewhat unconventional in our manager recommendations particularly in overseas equity markets, looking outside the relatively small universe of managers who offer balanced services to charities.
